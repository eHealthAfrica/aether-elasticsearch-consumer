## Aether Elasticsearch Kafka Consumer

This is an Aether Elasticsearch Kafka Consumer, which consumes dat–∞ from Kafka and feeds
into Elasticsearch instances.

The consumer runs on the Aether Consumer SDK, and can function in the multi-tenanted Aether environment.

### Running the app

The simplest way to try the consumer, is to use `aether-bootstrap` and opt for Elasticsearch integration. The after system setup, consumer API will then be available at `/{tenant}/es-consumer`. Please refer to the `aether-bootstrap` documentation for more details on getting started.

### Configuration

#### `conf/consumer/kafka.json`

To setup the main consumer, the kafka.json file should match your preferred Kafka settings. This is not user facing. The consumer running multi-tenanted assumes that you have employed topic level access control, and that a user coming from {tenant} should be allowed to read topics matching ^{tenant}.*

You can also set the default masking and message filtering settings here, but if specified, the user's rules will take precedence.

```json
{
    "aether_emit_flag_required" : false,
    "aether_masking_schema_emit_level": "false",
    "aether_masking_schema_levels" : ["false", "true"],
    "auto_offset_reset" : "earliest",
    "consumer_timeout_ms": 17000,
    "heartbeat_interval_ms": 2500,
    "request_timeout_ms": 20000,
    "session_timeout_ms": 18000
}
```

### Usage

As with all consumers built on the SDK, tasks are driven by a Job which has a set of Resources. In this case, a Job has a `subscription` to a topic (or wildcard) on Kafka, and sends data to a pair of`elasticsearch` and `kibana` instance. All resource examples and schemas can be found in `/consumer/app/fixtures`

#### Elasticsearch

(post to /elasticsearch/add as json)

```json
{
    "id": "es-test",
    "name": "Test ES Instance",
    "url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
}
```
#### Kibana

(post to /kibana/add as json)
```json
{
    "id": "k-test",
    "name": "Test Kibana Instance",
    "url": "http://kibana:5601/kibana-app",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
}
```
#### Subscription

(post to /subscription/add as json)

```json
{
    "id": "sub-test",
    "name": "Test Subscription",
    "topic_pattern": "*",
    "topic_options": {
        "masking_annotation": "@aether_masking",
        "masking_levels": ["public", "private"],
        "masking_emit_level": "public",
        "filter_required": true,
        "filter_field_path": "operational_status",
        "filter_pass_values": ["operational"]
    },
    "es_options": {
        "alias_name": "test",
        "auto_timestamp": true,
        "geo_point_creation": true,
        "geo_point_name": "geopoint"
    },
    "kibana_options": {
        "auto_visualization": "schema"
    },
    "visualizations": []
}
```

#### Job

Finally we, tie it together with a Job that references the above artifacts by ID.
(post to /job/add as json)

```json
{
    "id": "j-test-foreign",
    "name": "ES Consumer Job",
    "kibana": "k-test",
    "elasticsearch": "es-test",
    "subscription": ["sub-test"]
}
```


If the consumer is configured to use a default, multi-tenanted Elasticsearch/Kibana cluster, you can create artifacts those those via the `local_elasticsearch` && `local_kibana` API endpoints, and then reference them in a job like so:

```json
{
    "id": "j-test-local",
    "name": "ES Consumer Job using Local Cluster",
    "local_kibana": "default",
    "local_elasticsearch": "default",
    "subscription": ["sub-test"]
}
```

### Control and Artifact Functions

The Aether Consumer SDK allows exposure of functionality on a per Job or per Resource basis. You can query for a list of available functions on any of the artifacts by hitting its `describe` endpoint. For example; `/job/describe` yields:

```json
```
